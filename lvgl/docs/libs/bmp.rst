BMP decoder
===========

This extension allows the use of BMP images in LVGL. 

Library source: https://github.com/caj-johnson/bmp-decoder

The pixels are read on demand (not the whole image is loaded)
so using BMP images requires very little RAM.

If enabled in ``lv_conf.h`` by :c:macro:`LV_USE_BMP` LVGL will register a new
image decoder automatically so BMP files can be directly used as image
sources. For example:

.. code:: c

   lv_image_set_src(my_img, "S:path/to/picture.bmp");

Note that, a file system driver needs to registered to open images from
files. Read more about it :ref:`overview_file_system` or just
enable one in ``lv_conf.h`` with ``LV_USE_FS_...``

.. _bmp_limitations:

Limitations
-----------

-  Only BMP files are supported and BMP images as C array
   (:c:struct:`lv_image_dsc_t`) are not. It's because there is no practical
   differences between how the BMP files and LVGL's image format stores
   the image data.
-  BMP files can be loaded only from file. If you want to store them in
   flash it's better to convert them to C array with `LVGL's image converter <https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter>`__.
-  The BMP files color format needs to match with :c:macro:`LV_COLOR_DEPTH`.
   Use GIMP to save the image in the required format. Both RGB888 and
   ARGB888 works with :c:macro:`LV_COLOR_DEPTH` ``32``
-  Palette is not supported.
-  Because not the whole image is read in can not be zoomed or rotated.
